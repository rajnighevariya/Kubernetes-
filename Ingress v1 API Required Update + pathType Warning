When running kubectl apply in the upcoming lecture, you may encounter a warning or error about the v1beta1 API version that is being used.

The v1 Ingress API is now required as of Kubernetes v1.22 and the v1beta1 will no longer work.

A few very minor changes are needed:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/

1. A pathType needs to be added

2. How we specify the backend service name and port has changed

3. The kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation should be removed and replaced by the ingressClassName field under the spec:



apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-srv
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: posts.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /posts
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: posts-clusterip-srv
                port:
                  number: 4000
Cannot be used with pathType Prefix Warning
A few lectures from now, you may eventually see a warning in your terminal:

Warning: path /posts/?{.*}/comments cannot be used with pathType Prefix
Warning: path /?{.*} cannot be used with pathType Prefix

This is not an error and only a warning and does not cause a failure of the project. If you wish to suppress the warning and follow the latest guidance, then, you can use the ImplementationSpecific pathType as explained in the updated docs:

https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/#strict-validate-path-type

So, for any path that makes use of a regex, you would use ImplementationSpecific instead of Prefix.

eg:

          - path: /posts/?(.*)/comments
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
