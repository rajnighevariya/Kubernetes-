Please don't skip this!  You must make a small change to get a step shown in the next video to work correctly!

The next video is going to show the deployment of the React app to our Kubernetes cluster.  The React app will be running in a Docker container.

Unfortunately, create-react-app currently has two bugs that prevent it from running correctly in a docker container:

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/8688

https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11779



To solve this, we have to add two environment variables to the Dockerfile in the client folder.  Find the Dockerfile in the client folder and make the following change:

FROM node:alpine
 
# Add the following lines
ENV CI=true
ENV WDS_SOCKET_PORT=0
 
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY ./ ./
 
CMD ["npm", "start"]
Then save the file.  That's it!  Continue on to the next video.
